            <div class="question">Q1: "Tell us about yourself and your academic background."</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "My name is Debobrato Biswas, and I recently completed my studies in Software Engineering. My primary
                research interest lies at the intersection of <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Trustworthy AI</b>. For my
                Master's thesis, I developed the 'Elite Forensic Intelligence System', a hybrid framework for detecting
                counterfeit currency. I realized that standard deep learning models are often 'black boxes' and lack the
                precision for forensic tasks. To solve this, I fused a <b>Deep Autoencoder</b> for learning genuine
                texture manifolds with <b>deterministic Computer Vision algorithms</b> like Hough Transforms and OCR. I
                am particularly drawn to your lab because of your focus on industrial reliability, and I believe my
                background in building explainable hybrid systems makes me a strong candidate for this PhD position."
            </div>
            <div class="germany-note">
                <b>German Context:</b> Be concise (2-3 minutes max). They value precision.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="question">Q2: "Why do you want to pursue a PhD in Germany specifically?"</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "Germany stands at the forefront of <b>Industry 4.0</b> and Applied AI research, with institutions like
                Fraunhofer and Max Planck setting global standards. I specifically admire the German academic system's
                emphasis on rigorous engineering combined with deep theoretical foundations. I want to pursue my PhD
                here because I believe the structured yet independent research environment will allow me to mature not
                just as a coder, but as a scientific researcher capable of solving complex, real-world problems."

        <h2>Part 2: Deep Dive into YOUR Project (The Defense)</h2>
        <p><i>Expect 60% of the interview to focus on this. They will test if YOU wrote the code and understand the
                math.</i></p>

        <div class="card project-specific">
            <div class="question">Q3: "Why did you choose a Hybrid approach (Deep Learning + Classical CV) instead of an
                end-to-end CNN?"</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "That is a critical design choice. A pure CNN trained as a binary classifier (Real vs. Fake) suffers
                from two major issues. First, <b>Generalization</b>: Counterfeiters constantly improve, so a CNN trained
                on 'Fake V1' might fail on 'Fake V2'. Second, <b>Explainability</b>: In a legal context, saying '99%
                Fake' is insufficient. <br><br>
                By using a Hybrid approach, I get the best of both worlds. The Autoencoder learns the 'perfect' version
                of a note (One-Class Classification), so it flags <i>any</i> anomaly, even new types of fakes.
                Meanwhile, the Classical CV layer provides instant, human-verifiable feedback—for example, 'The security
                thread is misaligned by 3mm.' This makes the system both robust to unseen attacks and trusted by human
                operators, which is essential for forensic applications."

        <div class="card project-specific">
            <div class="question">Q4: "Explain the mathematics behind your Anomaly Detection score."</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "I modeled the problem as a <b>One-Class Classification</b> task. I trained a Deep Autoencoder
                exclusively on genuine samples to learn a manifold, $M$, that represents authentic currency. The
                objective function minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE): $L = || X - \hat{X} ||^2$. <br><br>
                During inference, when a counterfeit note $X'$ is fed into the network, it lies <i>outside</i> the
                learned manifold $M$. The network tries to project it back onto $M$, creating a reconstruction
                $\hat{X'}$ that looks identifyingly 'real'. The difference between the input and this reconstruction is
                large. I quantify this using the reconstruction error metric: $L_{rec} = || X' - \hat{X'} ||_2$. If this
                error exceeds a learned threshold $\tau$, the note is statistically determined to be an anomaly."

        <div class="card project-specific">
            <div class="question">Q5: "Why Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks? Why not standard ResNet or VGG blocks?"
            </div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "In banknote analysis, not all features are equally important. A plain background texture is less
                relevant than intricate micro-printing or watermarks. Standard Convolutional Networks treat all feature
                channels with equal importance. I integrated <b>Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks</b> to introduce
                'feature recalibration'. <br><br>
                The 'Squeeze' operation pools global spatial information, while the 'Excitation' operation uses a small
                neural network to assign channel-wise weights. This allows the model to 'focus' 80% on the watermark
                channel and only 20% on the background, significantly improving sensitivity to high-quality 'Supernote'
                forgeries."

        <div class="card project-specific">
            <div class="question">Q6: "How did you determine the fusion weights ($\alpha=0.6, \beta=1.0$)? Is this
                heuristic or learned?"</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "Currently, the weights $\alpha=0.6$ and $\beta=1.0$ are hyperparameters that I tuned via Grid Search on
                my validation set to maximize the F1-score. <br><br>
                However, for my PhD research, I propose to replace this static weighting with a learnable <b>Gating
                    Network</b> (similar to a Mixture of Experts). This network would dynamically adjust the reliance on
                CV vs. DL based on the input image's noise level—for example, trusting the CV layer more if the image is
                blurry, or the DL layer more if the lighting is poor."

        <h2>Part 3: General AI/ML & Data Science Theory</h2>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="question">Q7: "What is the difference between Generative (Autoencoder/GAN) and Discriminative
                (CNN Classifier) models?"</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "<b>Discriminative models</b> learn the conditional probability $P(Y|X)$—drawing a boundary between
                classes (Real vs Fake). They require labeled data for both classes. <br><br>
                <b>Generative models</b>, like my Autoencoder, learn the joint probability $P(X)$ or the distribution of
                the data itself. I chose a Generative approach because 'fake' currency is rare and diverse; it is
                impossible to collect a balanced dataset of all possible fakes. By modeling the distribution of the
                'Real' class, I can detect <i>any</i> deviation as an anomaly, without needing to see it during
                training."
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="question">Q8: "How does the 'Curse of Dimensionality' affect your model working with high-res
                images?"</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "The Curse of Dimensionality states that as dimensions increase, the volume of the feature space
                increases exponentially, making data sparse. In high-dimensional space (like 4K images), distance
                metrics like Euclidean distance become meaningless because all points become roughly equidistant.
                <br><br>
                I solved this by using the Autoencoder to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction. The Encoder
                compresses the high-dimensional input into a compact <b>Latent Space</b> (Bottleneck), where the
                essential manifold structure is preserved, making distance-based anomaly detection mathematically valid
                again."
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="question">Q9: "Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff."</div>
            <div class="answer-guide">
                "The <b>High Bias (Underfitting)</b> error occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying
                pattern (e.g., fitting a line to curved data). <b>High Variance (Overfitting)</b> occurs when a model is
                too complex and captures random noise in the training data rather than the signal. <br><br>
                In my Autoencoder, if the bottleneck is too wide, it could simply 'memorize' the input (Identity
                Function), leading to High Variance. I prevented this by constraining the bottleneck and using
                Regularization, ensuring the model learns robust features rather than just memorizing the training set."

            <div class="answer-guide">
                "I see three main avenues for my doctoral research: <br>
                1. <b>Few-Shot Learning:</b> Currently, the model needs retraining for every currency. I want to use
